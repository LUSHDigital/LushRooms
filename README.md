# LushRooms

This is the main LushRooms project repository, including links to the different physical and digital components making the LushRoom Pi sound and light media player.

## Lushroom Pi

The Lushroom Pi is a media player box that uses electronic components (a Raspberry Pi, a touchscreen, a Tinkerforge brick and a Tinkerforge DMX bricklet) to provide synchronised sound and light.

It has been originally developed to support the light, sound and experience design of the Lush Spa treatments.
